      "question": "What is tokenization?",
      "answer": "Tokenization is the process of transforming data into unique tokens that can be used in place of sensitive information in systems."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the benefits of tokenization?",
      "answer": "Tokenization secures data, reduces fraud, and ensures privacy compliance by replacing sensitive data with tokens."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does tokenization work?",
      "answer": "When data is tokenized, the original data is stored securely while the token is used in applications and transactions in its place."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is tokenization secure?",
      "answer": "Yes—because tokens are meaningless outside the vault that maps them back to the original data, the risk of data exposure is greatly reduced."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where can tokenization be used?",
      "answer": "Tokenization is widely used in payment processing, healthcare records, and any system handling PII (Personally Identifiable Information)."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are tokens tied to the source data?",
      "answer": "No—tokens themselves carry no intrinsic value or meaning, and cannot be reverse-engineered without access to the secure token vault."
    }
